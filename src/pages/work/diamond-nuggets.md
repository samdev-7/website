[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) has iron and gold nuggets, but where are the diamond nuggets?

Diamond Nuggets was a silly idea that I made a reality as an excuse to learn Java and Minecraft modding. Gaining over **900,000 downloads**, Diamond Nuggets was more popular than I anticipated.

It's literally just a mod that adds diamond nuggets, but it serves some practical uses. Diamonds are commonly used as a form of currency in multiplayer communities due to it's hard-to-obtain nature, and diamond nuggets make it easier to trade in smaller denominations.

Diamong Nuggets is built for the two popular modding toolchains, [Forge](https://minecraftforge.net/) and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). I hope to clean up the files to open source it in the future.
