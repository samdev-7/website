**150 teens, 44 hours, and 40 ships** — Apocalypse is the **largest high-school hackathon in Canada,** and I'm proud to be part of the team that made it happen.

We gathered 150 high school students from across Canada & beyond at Shopify's Toronto office and tasked them to build whatever they wanted to survive a zombie apocalypse, within 44 continuous hours.

It was a [chaotic](tooltip "in a good way") weekend filled with loads of hardware, custom swag—including a custom card game and [PCB badge](https://github.com/LimesKey/NameTagPCB)—and our own economy of bottle caps that evolved into [something we didn't expect](tooltip "also in a good way"). You should check out the [wild projects](https://apocalypse.hackclub.com/ships) that were shipped, they're really cool.

Apocalypse was an ambitious, one-of-a-kind event. [Watch the recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvCoISXfcE8).

Much thanks to [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), [Shopify](https://shopify.com), the amazing organizing team I was able to work with, and our participants for making this event remarkable.

P.S. I want to bring these events to more places. I'm now leading Counterspell Ottawa, the first high school in-person hackathon in Ottawa. Check out our site at <https://counterspell.hackclub.com/ottawa>.
